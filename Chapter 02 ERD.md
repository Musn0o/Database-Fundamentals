### Important Definitions

- **Attribute**: The property of an entity that describes its characteristics.
- **Single/Simple Attribute**: An attribute that can have only one value.
- **Composite Attribute**: An attribute that can be divided into smaller subparts. (e.g., address)
- **Multivalued Attribute**: Has a set of values for the same entity instance. (e.g., phone numbers)
- **Derived Attribute**: An attribute that is calculated from other attributes. (e.g., age from birth date)
- **Candidate Key**: When an entity has more than one key, those are candidate keys. (e.g., employee_id, SSD, email)
- **Weak entity**: An entity that doesn't have a key attribute and must be fully dependant on another entity.
- **Relationships**: The connection between entity classes. (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
